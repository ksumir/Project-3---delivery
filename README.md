# Project 3 - delivery

*Run an A/B test to compare two groups of users—those using the new recommendation system and those using the old app version. The comparison will be based on three things: average order value, average number of orders, and total revenue.*

__`tech stack:`__  `EDA`, `A/B test`: t-test, `Python`: Jupyter Notebook (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy.stats, numpy)

__`steps:`__ <br>
• performing EDA, <br>
• selecting, calculating metrics (average number of orders, average order value, revenue), and conducting A/B tests (t-test), <br>
• reaching conclusions.
